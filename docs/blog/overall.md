# Overal performance

This section presents the high-level performance of the three 5GCs under evaluation. We present the time taken to complete the registration and de-registration procedures for a given number of UEs and the average time it takes to complete registration and de-registration of a single UE. In both cases, we show the results as the UE load increases. Open5GS leads in performance, with free5GC coming next and OAI trailing behind.
